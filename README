THIS MODEL REQUIRES MINIMUM MODIFICATIONS TO BE EXECUTED UNDER THE ECLIPSE PLATFORM.
READ THE CONTENTS OF THE *.BAT FILES AND USE THEM TO RUN THE SIMULATIONS.

This is the readme file for assignment 2

INSTALLATION
------------
The zip file should include the following files:

README - file you are reading now
repair_robot.ma - Cell-DEVS model for this assignment
xxx.ma - Dummy Cell-DEVS model used with Graflog.  See below for details.
collision_test1.bat - batch file to run simulation 
collision_test2.bat - batch file to run simulation 
collision_test3.bat - batch file to run simulation 
collision_test1.val
collision_test2.val
collision_test3.val
damage_repair_test1.bat - batch file to run simulation  
damage_repair_test2.bat - batch file to run simulation 
damage_repair_test1.val
damage_repair_test2.val
repair_robot.pal - Palette to use when looking at my .drw files with the Graflog applet. 

The batch files were written assuming the simu.exe and drawlog.exe executables were located in the directory above where the batch files are located.

RUNNING SIMULATIONS
-------------------

1. It seems Graflog has a bug where it cannot run a valid .drw if the associated .ma is a three dimensional model.  I guess Graflog cannot get height and width from the dim(x,y,z) found in a three dimensional .ma.  Therefore I provided xxx.ma which is the .ma file to use to see all .drw with Graflog.

2. Execute the batch files in any order you want.  They each produce a .log and a .drw such that: *.bat produces *.log and *.drw.

3. Have a look at the .drw using xxx.ma and repair_robot.pal.

4. My report explains what the .drw are.
